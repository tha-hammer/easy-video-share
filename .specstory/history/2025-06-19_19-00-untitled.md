Review the documentation.

Remember, I'm using the "cloud resume challenge" process to learn cloud engineering concepts.

We have an app that allows for uploads to a single bucket on S3 and displays the contents of the bucket on the upload page.

I want to build up to allowing for login and user accounts. As an MVP step, I want to add an api to communicate with a dynamodb. The database should record the username, the file name and the bucket location.  The upload form should add a filed for the username.

I'll help you add DynamoDB integration and an API layer to your video sharing app. Let me first review your current setup and then provide a plan for implementing user tracking with DynamoDB.

Perfect! I've reviewed your documentation and current setup. You have a solid foundation with:

1. **Current Architecture**: S3-based video storage with direct frontend uploads
2. **Terraform Infrastructure**: S3 bucket with proper policies and IAM user
3. **Vite.js Frontend**: Direct S3 uploads with progress tracking

Now let's implement your MVP step to add DynamoDB tracking with username support. Here's my plan:

## Implementation Plan

1. **Add DynamoDB table to Terraform** - for tracking video metadata
2. **Create Lambda API functions** - to handle database operations  
3. **Update IAM permissions** - for Lambda to access DynamoDB
4. **Add API Gateway** - to expose the Lambda functions
5. **Update frontend** - to include username field and call the API
6. **Modify upload flow** - to record metadata in DynamoDB

Let's start implementing:
